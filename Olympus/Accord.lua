-- 1.2.5.1: the Olympus Accord, Olympus's terms of use (its name in one place: L.ACCORD_NAME). A
-- letter on parchment, in Olympus's own window, that every account accepts once before Olympus
-- works: until then ns.IsMember is false (Core.lua), so this client sends nothing and hears nothing
-- of the army, and the Olympus window shows the Accord's page alone (UI.lua). The privacy page
-- (Consent.lua) comes after it, as before.
--
-- When it asks: LOGIN_WAIT after login, then every RETRY until it could (never in combat or an
-- instance, as the privacy page); when the window opens, when the author's signed list makes our
-- guild an Olympus guild, when this account's BattleTag changed and on /oly privacy (each of these
-- a deliberate ask: Not now at login is for the login's tries alone). Not now saves nothing: the
-- next login asks again. Accepted: ns.db.accord, for the game account (its alts are not asked
-- again): the version, when, and 8 bits of the BattleTag's hash (fp), enough to see it changed
-- (one change in 256 goes unseen until the next version), never the tag itself: with 16 a known
-- name's digits came back from the file almost alone. A higher ns.ACCORD_VERSION asks again.
--
-- The BattleTag. Only the player's own, read from his own game (BNGetInfo, as Blizzard's own
-- FriendsFrame reads it once Battle.net is connected, on every supported client); I accept is
-- enabled only while it can be read. An account that accepted is never locked out by a Battle.net
-- outage: the gate (ns.AccordAccepted) reads saved data alone, and Check acts only on a tag it read.
-- It shows masked on the letter (its digits; Show reveals them for REVEAL seconds), and on the
-- King's screen (Stream: his character, any character of his game account once it was seen
-- there, his preview) no part of it, with no Show (he streams).
--
-- Who gets it in game: the moderation team alone (WatchChat.InRoom: the author, the King, the High
-- Council and the Olympus moderators they named). A team member's client asks on the Olympus
-- channel (BQ, ASK_FIRST after login, then every ASK_EVERY); each player's client that accepted
-- answers that one asker by a logged whisper (BT), after a random delay, at most once every
-- TELL_EVERY from each character to each asker, and only to an asker of the team level of its own
-- or higher (WatchChat.ActorLevel): an ordinary player's goes to any team member, a moderator's to
-- the moderators and above, a councillor's to the council, the King and the author, the King's to
-- the author alone. Nothing goes to a team member who did not just show he is online; the
-- server's "No player named..." for one who left meanwhile drops what waits for him and, with
-- mouse and keyboard (the gamepad gate's system-filters), stays out of the chat for QUIET seconds
-- after our whisper. Nothing ever goes on the channel or GUILD, and no other player's client keeps
-- or shows one. The team's clients keep them (ns.rdb.battletags, KEEP after the last one) while
-- they are on the team (Guard: wiped at once on its own sanction or a lost seat, else TEAM_GRACE
-- off the team), and The Watch shows them, grouped by tag (the characters one player plays), the
-- digits hidden until the page's Show (REVEAL seconds), and on the King's screen no part of a tag,
-- his eye button included. `/oly accord forget <name>` drops that player's tag on a team client (a
-- removal asked for). A tag is what that player's own addon read and sent: a modified addon can
-- send someone else's. Its one automatic use: a sanction follows the BattleTag (TagFollow.lua), a
-- code of it reaching every client, each applying it to its own player alone; nothing goes out by
-- name on a match alone, and a wrong follow is stopped from The Watch (`/oly accord unfollow <name>`).
-- That code is made of the tag and this game account's follow key (AccountKey: 16 random hex digits
-- made once, at the first accept, kept through later ones, and sent with the tag in BT alone), so
-- only the team can tell whose BattleTag a code is, and a copied tag gives a code no other account
-- has. The King's game account (ns.db.kingAccount) answers the King and the author alone, as his
-- own character does.
--
-- The Olympus Companion app (the letter's ACCORD_T5_3): once accepted, the bridge's "self" section
-- (BridgeSections.lua) hands this character's name and own tag, read here (ReadTag), to the private
-- sidecar a Companion user installed, which saves it in its own file at logout or /reload; the
-- Companion takes it to Olympus's online census, where only its staff see BattleTags. Nothing is
-- sent in game for it, and the tags a team client keeps of others never go there (nor the follow
-- key: it goes in BT alone).
